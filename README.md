# Sorting Algorithms in Rust

This project implements four sorting algorithms in Rust: Quick Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort. Each algorithm is implemented as a separate function in the `sorting_library` crate.

## Quick Sort: 
Quick sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort elements. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted.

## Selection Sort:
Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and moving it to the beginning. It gradually builds up a sorted portion of the array from left to right.

## Insertion Sort:
Insertion sort is another simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It works by iterating through the array and repeatedly moving elements that are out of order into their correct position within the sorted portion of the array.

## Merge Sort:
Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by recursively dividing the array into smaller sub-arrays until each sub-array contains only one element. It then merges these sub-arrays back together in a sorted order.

# Usage

To use the sorting algorithms provided in this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tomirisospanova/sorting-algorithms-rust.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd sorting-algorithms-rust
    ```

3. Open the `src/main.rs` file and modify it to sort your desired array of elements. You can also modify or extend the sorting algorithms in `src/lib.rs` if needed.
